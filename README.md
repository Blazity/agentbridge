# AgentBridge

This monorepo contains the AgentBridge client library and CLI tool for processing and transforming APIs into the AgentBridge Protocol format.

## Overview

AgentBridge simplifies the process of making APIs accessible to AI agents by transforming traditional API specifications into a standardized format optimized for agent consumption. The project consists of two main components:

1. **CLI Tool**: Convert OpenAPI/Swagger specifications to AgentBridge Protocol format
2. **Client Library**: Interact with APIs using AgentBridge Protocol schemas

## Components

- [CLI Tool](packages/cli/README.md) - Command-line interface for converting API specifications
- [Client Library](packages/client/README.md) - TypeScript library for interacting with AgentBridge-compatible APIs
